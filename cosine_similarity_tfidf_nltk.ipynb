Talcott of Boston\\'s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\\nDr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University. \\n\\nThe Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in \"very modest amounts\" in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956.\\nFrom 1953 to 1955, 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold, the company said. \\n\\nAmong 33 men who worked closely with the substance, 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number.\\nFour of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases, including three with recently diagnosed cancer.\\nThe total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma, lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected, the researchers said. \\n\\n\"The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos-related diseases,\" said Dr. Talcott. \\n\\nThe percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton, Mass., paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries, he said.\\nThe plant, which is owned by Hollingsworth & Vose Co., was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters. \\n\\nThe finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos, chrysotile, found in most schools and other buildings, Dr. Talcott said. \\n\\nThe U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that doesn\\'t have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth, needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles, according to Brooke T. Mossman, a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine.\\nMore common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body, Dr. Mossman explained. \\n\\nIn July, the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos.\\nBy 1997, almost all remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos will be outlawed. \\n\\nAbout 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s.\\nAreas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used.\\nWorkers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin, poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters.\\nWorkers described \"clouds of blue dust\" that hung over parts of the factory, even though exhaust fans ventilated the area. \\n\\n\"There\\'s no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos-related diseases,\" said Darrell Phillips, vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose. \"But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago.\\nIt has no bearing on our work force today.\" \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0004': '.START \\n\\nYields on money-market mutual funds continued to slide, amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates. \\n\\nThe average seven-day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue\\'s Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45% from 8.47% for the week ended Tuesday.\\nCompound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year. \\n\\nAverage maturity of the funds\\' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days, the longest since early August, according to Donoghue\\'s.\\nLonger maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period.\\nShorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner. \\n\\nThe average maturity for funds open only to institutions, considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely, reached a high point for the year -- 33 days. \\n\\nNevertheless, said Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report, yields \"may blip up again before they blip down\" because of recent rises in short-term interest rates.\\nThe yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday\\'s auction, for example, rose to 8.04% from 7.90%. \\n\\nDespite recent declines in yields, investors continue to pour cash into money funds.\\nAssets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $1.5 billion during the latest week, to $352.7 billion. \\n\\nTypically, money-fund yields beat comparable short-term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates.\\nThe top money funds are currently yielding well over 9%.\\nDreyfus World-Wide Dollar, the top-yielding fund, had a seven-day compound yield of 9.37% during the latest week, down from 9.45% a week earlier.\\nIt invests heavily in dollar-denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees, which boosts its yield.\\nThe average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12%, down from 8.14%.\\nThe 30-day simple yield fell to an average 8.19% from 8.22%; the 30-day compound yield slid to an average 8.53% from 8.56%. \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0005': \".START \\n\\nJ.P.

Simon & Co., a Washington-based research firm. \\n\\nThe turf recently has ranged from Chile to Austria to Portugal.\\nNext week, the Philippine Fund\\'s launch will be capped by a visit by Philippine

George Foot, a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates of Northampton, Mass.\\nThe recent explosion of country funds mirrors the \"closed-end fund mania\" of the 1920s, Mr. Foot says, when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular.\\nThey fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash. \\n\\nUnlike traditional open-end mutual funds, most of these one-country portfolios are the \"closed-end\" type, issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly. \\n\\nThe surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in New York or London.\\nThese funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets. \\n\\n\"People are looking to stake their claims\" now before the number of available nations runs out, says Michael Porter, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., New York. \\n\\nBehind all the hoopla is some heavy-duty competition.\\nAs individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years, securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell.\\nAnd the firms are stretching their nets far and wide to do it. \\n\\nFinancial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities.\\nAnd many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets, such as the U.S. and Japan.\\nCountry funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies. \\n\\nBut it doesn\\'t take much to get burned.\\nPolitical and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds.\\nAnother concern: The funds\\' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market.\\nWhen the stock market dropped nearly 7% Oct. 13, for instance, the Mexico Fund plunged about 18% and the Spain Fund fell 16%.\\nAnd most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the 1987 crash. \\n\\nWhat\\'s so wild about the funds\\' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios.\\nAfter trading at an average discount of more than 20% in late 1987 and part of last year, country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6%.\\nThe reason: Share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold. \\n\\nIt\\'s probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors, such as South Korea, some specialists say.\\nBut some European funds recently have skyrocketed; Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120% premium.\\nIt has been targeted by Japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to 1992\\'s European economic integration.\\nAnd several new funds that aren\\'t even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums. \\n\\n\"I\\'m very alarmed to see these rich valuations,\" says Smith Barney\\'s Mr. Porter. \\n\\nThe newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds, Mr. Porter suggests.\\nUnlike many U.S. investors, those in Asia or Europe seeking foreign-stock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds. \\n\\n\"There may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here,\" Mr. Porter says. \\n\\nNonetheless, plenty of U.S. analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds.\\nThey argue that U.S. investors often can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds; these so-called ADRs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the U.S.\\nThat way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium. \\n\\nFor people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds, Newgate\\'s Mr. Foot says: \"The only advice I have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly.\" \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0035': '.START \\n\\nThe U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible

from the $415.8 billion reported for August.\\nPrivate construction spending was down, but government building activity was up.\\nThe figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns, but weren\\'t adjusted for inflation. \\n\\nKenneth Mayland, economist for Society Corp., a Cleveland bank, said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off.\\nAt the same time, the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry. \\n\\n\"What sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack?\" he asked. \"I draw a blank.\" \\n\\nBy most measures, the nation\\'s industrial sector is now growing very slowly -- if at all.\\nFactory payrolls fell in September.\\nSo did the Federal Reserve Board\\'s industrial-production index. \\n\\nYet many economists aren\\'t predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession.\\nThey cite a lack of \"imbalances\" that provide early warning signals of a downturn. \\n\\nInventories are closely watched for such clues, for instance.\\nEconomists say a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession.\\nBut yesterday\\'s factory orders report had good news on that front: it said factory inventories fell 0.1% in September, the first decline since February 1987. \\n\\n\"This conforms to the `soft landing\\' scenario,\" said Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. \"I don\\'t see any signs that inventories are excessive.\" A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession. \\n\\nThe department said orders for nondurable goods -- those intended to last fewer than three years -- fell 0.3% in September to $109.73 billion after climbing 0.9% the month before.\\nOrders for durable goods were up 0.2% to $127.03 billion after rising 3.9% the month before.\\nThe department previously estimated that durable-goods orders fell 0.1% in September. \\n\\nFactory shipments fell 1.6% to $234.4 billion after rising 5.4% in August.\\nShipments have been relatively level since January, the Commerce Department noted. \\n\\nManufacturers\\' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5% in September to $497.34 billion, helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector.\\nExcluding these orders, backlogs declined 0.3%. \\n\\nIn its construction spending report, the Commerce Department said residential construction, which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending, was off 0.9% in September to an annual rate of $191.9 billion.\\nDavid Berson, economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes, but probably not until early next year. \\n\\nSpending on private, nonresidential construction was off 2.6% to an annual rate of $99.1 billion with no sector showing strength.\\nGovernment construction spending rose 4.3% to $88 billion. \\n\\nAfter adjusting for inflation, the Commerce Department said construction spending didn\\'t change in September. \\n\\nFor the first nine months of the year, total construction spending ran about 2% above last year\\'s level. \\n\\nThe government\\'s construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by McGraw-Hill

overtime just for the sake of solidarity, that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager, and that Sony was chary of letting a young, short-term American employee take on any responsibility.\\nAll of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. Katzenstein, who went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another Walkman. \\n\\nBut Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. Katzenstein, after he committed the social crime of making an

political campaigns, became the main event. \\n\\nThe irony is that the attack commercial, after getting a boost in last year\\'s presidential campaign, has come of age in an off-off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country. \\n\\nBut in the three leading political contests of 1989, the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility, raising fears that this kind of mudslinging, empty of significant issues, is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content. \\n\\n\"Now,\" says Joseph Napolitan, a pioneer in political television, \"the idea is to attack first, last and always.\" \\n\\nA trend that started with the first stirrings of politics, accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes-tawdry art form in 1988, has reached an entirely new stage. \\n\\n\"To get people\\'s attention these days,\" says Douglas Bailey, a political consultant, \"your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining, and, more often than not, that means confrontational.\\nAnd, unlike a few years ago, you don\\'t even have to worry whether the ad is truthful.\" \\n\\nIn 1989, as often as not, the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves. \\n\\nTake a look, then, at the main attack commercials that set the tone for Tuesday\\'s elections in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia: \\n\\nNew York City: The screen fills with a small, tight facial shot of David Dinkins, Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City. \"David Dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years,\" says a disembodied male voice. \\n\\nAnd then this television commercial, paid for by Republican Rudolph Giuliani\\'s campaign and produced by Roger Ailes, the master of negative TV ads, really gets down to business.\\nMr. Dinkins, the ad charges, also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately, hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper \"through a phony organization with no members, no receipts and no office.\" \\n\\n\"David Dinkins,\" says the kicker, \"Why does he always wait until he\\'s caught?\" \\n\\n\"Nasty innuendoes,\" says John Siegal, Mr. Dinkins\\'s issues director, \"designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply doesn\\'t exist.\" \\n\\nStung by the Giuliani ads, Mr. Dinkins\\'s TV consultants, Robert Shrum and David Doak, finally unleashed a negative ad of their own.\\nThe screen shows two distorted, unrecognizable photos, presumably of two politicians. \"Compare two candidates for mayor,\" says the announcer. \"One says he\\'s for banning cop-killer bullets.\\nThe other has opposed a ban on cop-killer bullets.\\nOne claims he\\'s pro-choice.\\nThe other has opposed a woman\\'s right to choose.\" \\n\\n\"Funny thing,\" says the kicker, \"both these candidates are named Rudolph Giuliani.\" \\n\\nWho\\'s telling the truth?\\nEverybody -- and nobody.\\nIt\\'s a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate. \\n\\nMr. Dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years, but he insists he voluntarily admitted the \"oversight\" when he was being considered for a city job.\\nHe was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems, but he insists he made no secret of it.\\nThe city\\'s Campaign Finance Board has refused to pay Mr. Dinkins $95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete.\\nThe campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors.\\nAnd, says Mr. Dinkins, he didn\\'t know the man his campaign paid for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping.\\nBut, say Mr. Dinkins\\'s managers, he did have an office and his organization did have members. \\n\\nMr. Giuliani\\'s campaign chairman, Peter Powers, says the Dinkins ad is \"deceptive.\" The other side, he argues, \"knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice, even though he has personal reservations.\\nThey know he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets, but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation.\" \\n\\nVirginia: Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force.\\nAgainst a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag, an announcer talks about the \"strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty\" that Virginians have nurtured for generations.\\nThen, just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen, the announcer continues: \"On the issue of abortion, Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians.\" \\n\\nThat commercial -- which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion \"even in cases of rape and incest,\" a charge Mr. Coleman denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign, transforming it, at least in part, into a referendum on abortion.\\nThe ad prompted Mr. Coleman, the former Virginia attorney general, to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder\\'s support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad. \\n\\nThe Coleman counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal.\\nA voice says, \"C\\'mon, now, don\\'t you have boyfriends?\" Then an announcer interjects: \"It was Douglas Wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists.\\nSo the next time Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women, ask him about this law he tried to pass.\" \\n\\nMr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago, but he did so at the request of a constituent, a common legislative technique used by lawmakers.\\nThe legislation itself noted that it was introduced \"by request,\" and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation. \\n\\n\"People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner,\" says Mark Rozell, a political scientist at Mary Washington College. \"Wilder has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman.\" \\n\\nMr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning, but the truce lasted only hours.\\nBy Tuesday night, television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder\\'s sensitivity to rape victims. \\n\\nNew Jersey: The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio\\'s rival, Republican Rep. Jim Courter. \"Remember Pinocchio?\" says a female voice. \"Consider Jim Courter.\" \\n\\nAnd then this commercial, produced by Bob Squier, gets down to its own mean and dirty business.\\nPictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus, and the female voice purrs, \"That hazardous waste on his {Mr.\\nCourter\\'s} property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud.\" And the nose on Mr. Courter\\'s face grows. \\n\\nThe only fraud involved, cry Mr. Courter\\'s partisans, is the Florio commercial itself, and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial, produced by Mr. Ailes.\\nIn this one, the screen fills with photographs of both candidates. \"Who\\'s really lying?\" asks a female voice. \"Florio\\'s lying,\" the voice goes on, because \"the barrel on Courter\\'s land . . . contained heating oil, was cleaned up and caused no pollution.\" \\n\\nMr. Courter\\'s long nose shrinks while Mr. Florio\\'s grows. \\n\\nWho\\'s telling the truth?\\nStephen Salmore, a political scientist at New Jersey\\'s Eagleton Institute, says it\\'s another example of an ad that\\'s true but not fully accurate.\\nBarrels were dumped on the Courter property, a complaint was made, but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment. \\n\\nEven so, according to Mr. Salmore, the ad was \"devastating\" because it raised questions about Mr. Courter\\'s credibility.\\nBut it\\'s building on a long tradition.\\nIn 1966, on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O\\'Connor, GOP Gov.

analysts and business people in the U.S. suggest that Japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that Southeast Asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades.\\nBut Japan\\'s power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions. \\n\\nThe flow of Japanese funds has set in motion \"a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great Japanese investment machine,\" says Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International Corp. \\n\\nIn the past five years, Japanese companies have tripled their commitments in Asia to $5.57 billion.\\nIn Thailand, for example, the government\\'s Board of Investment approved $705.6 million of Japanese investment in 1988, 10 times the U.S. investment figure for the year.\\nJapan\\'s commitment in Southeast Asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade. \\n\\nAsia\\'s other cash-rich countries are following Japan\\'s lead and pumping capital into the region.\\nIn Taiwan and South Korea, rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor-intensive production.\\nThese nations, known as Asia\\'s \"little tigers,\" also are contributing to Southeast Asia\\'s integration, but their influence will remain subordinate to Japan\\'s. \\n\\nFor recipient countries such as Thailand and Malaysia, the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth.\\nBut Asian nations\\' harsh memories of their military domination by Japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under Japanese economic hegemony now. \\n\\nBecause of budget constraints in Washington, the U.S. encourages Japan to share economic burdens in the region.\\nBut it resists yielding political ground.\\nIn the coming decade, analysts say, U.S.-Japanese relations will be tested as Tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region\\'s economic behemoth. \\n\\nJapan\\'s swelling investment in Southeast Asia is part of its economic evolution.\\nIn the past decade, Japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export.\\nIn the 1990s, spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen, these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world.\\nTo capture the investment, Southeast Asian nations will move to accommodate Japanese business. \\n\\nThese nations\\' internal decisions \"will be made in a way not to offend their largest aid donor, largest private investor and largest lender,\" says Richard Drobnick, director of the international business and research program at the University of Southern California\\'s Graduate School of Business. \\n\\nJapanese money will help turn Southeast Asia into a more cohesive economic region.\\nBut, analysts say, Asian cooperation isn\\'t likely to parallel the European Common Market approach.\\nRather, Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors, says Kent Calder, a specialist in East Asian economies at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs at Princeton University.\\nIn electronics, for example, a Japanese company might make television picture tubes in Japan, assemble the sets in Malaysia and export them to Indonesia. \\n\\n\"The effect will be to pull Asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone,\" says Goldman Sachs\\'s Mr. Hormats. \\n\\nCountries in the region also are beginning to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties.\\nThe economic and foreign ministers of 12 Asian and Pacific nations will meet in Australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications.\\nParticipants will include the U.S., Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand as well as the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei. \\n\\nIn addition, the U.S. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the Pacific rim in a major speech by Secretary of State James Baker, following up a proposal made in January by Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke. \\n\\nThe Baker proposal reasserts Washington\\'s intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region. \"In Asia, as in Europe, a new order is taking shape,\" Mr. Baker said. \"The U.S., with its regional friends, must play a crucial role in designing its architecture.\" \\n\\nBut maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region.\\nJapan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries (although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia).\\nMoreover, the Japanese government, now the world\\'s largest aid donor, is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U.S. is.\\nWhile U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan\\'s enlarged role in Asia, they also convey an undertone of caution. \"There\\'s an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions\" in Asia, says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary of commerce for trade. \"If they approach it with a benevolent, altruistic attitude, there will be a net gain for everyone.\" \\n\\nSome Asian nations are apprehensive about Washington\\'s demand that Tokyo step up its military spending to ease the U.S. security burden in the region.\\nThe issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the U.S.\\'s leases on military bases in the Philippines and by a possible U.S. troop reduction in South Korea.\\nMany Asians regard a U.S. presence as a desirable counterweight to Japanese influence. \\n\\n\"No one wants the U.S. to pick up its marbles and go home,\" Mr. Hormats says. \\n\\nFor their part, Taiwan and South Korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the Japanese juggernaut. \\n\\n\"They don\\'t want Japan to monopolize the region and sew it up,\" says Chong-sik Lee, professor of East Asian politics at the University of Pennsylvania. \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0044': '.START \\n\\nCathryn Rice could hardly believe her eyes.\\nWhile giving the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills to ninth graders at Greenville High School last March 16, she spotted a student looking at crib sheets. \\n\\nShe had seen cheating before, but these notes were uncanny. \"A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance. . . . At the end of World War II, Germany surrendered before Japan. . . . The Senate-House conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the House and Senate in different forms.\" \\n\\nVirtually word for word, the notes matched questions and answers on the social-studies section of the test the student was taking.\\nIn fact, the student had the answers to almost all of the 40 questions in that section.\\nThe student surrendered the notes, but not without a protest. \"My teacher said it was OK for me to use the notes on the test,\" he said. \\n\\nThe teacher in question was Nancy Yeargin -- considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school.\\nConfronted, Mrs. Yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low-ability geography classes.\\nShe had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers. \\n\\nMrs. Yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual South Carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security.\\nIn September, she pleaded guilty and paid a $500 fine.\\nHer alternative was 90 days in jail. \\n\\nHer story is partly one of personal downfall.\\nShe was an unstinting teacher who won laurels and inspired students, but she will probably never teach again.\\nIn her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer; of colleagues who say she brought them shame; of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly; and of school-district officials stunned that despite the bald-faced nature of her actions, she became something of a local martyr. \\n\\nMrs. Yeargin\\'s case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform, where pressures on teachers are growing and where high-stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat.\\nThe 1987 statute Mrs. Yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of South Carolina\\'s school-improvement laws.\\nProsecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students\\' scores to win a bonus under the state\\'s 1984 Education Improvement Act.\\nThe bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student-test scores. \\n\\n\"There is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores,\" says Walt Haney, an education professor and testing specialist at Boston College. \"So efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise.\" And most disturbing, it is educators, not students, who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing. \\n\\nA 50-state study released in September by Friends for Education, an Albuquerque, N.M., school-research group, concluded that \"outright cheating by American educators\" is \"common.\" The group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often \"teach the test\" as Mrs. Yeargin did, although most are never caught. \\n\\nEvidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so.\\nCalifornia\\'s education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test.\\nAfter numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students, Texas is revising its security practices. \\n\\nAnd sales of test-coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming.\\nThese materials, including Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. \\'s Scoring High and Learning Materials -- are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets, according to some recent academic research.\\nBy using them, teachers -- with administrative blessing -- telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate, and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers.\\nUse of Scoring High is widespread in South Carolina and common in Greenville County, Mrs. Yeargin\\'s school district. \\n\\nExperts say there isn\\'t another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in South Carolina. \\n\\nUnder the state\\'s Education Improvement Act, low test scores can block students\\' promotions or force entire districts into wrenching, state-supervised \"interventions\" that can mean firings.\\nHigh test scores, on the other hand, bring recognition and extra money -- a new computer lab for a school, grants for special projects, a bonus for the superintendent. \\n\\nAnd South Carolina says it is getting results.\\nSince the reforms went in place, for example, no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than South Carolina, although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about 21 states who use the SAT as the primary college entrance examination.\\nCritics say South Carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much.\\nFriends of Education rates South Carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating.\\nSays the organization\\'s founder, John Cannell, prosecuting Mrs. Yeargin is \"a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously, when in fact they don\\'t take it seriously at all.\" \\n\\nPaul Sandifer, director of testing for the South Carolina department of education, says Mr. Cannell\\'s allegations of cheating \"are purely without foundation,\" and based on unfair inferences.\\nPartly because of worries about potential abuse, however, he says the state will begin keeping closer track of achievement-test preparation booklets next spring. \\n\\nSouth Carolina\\'s reforms were designed for schools like Greenville High School.\\nStanding on a shaded hill in a run-down area of this old textile city, the school has educated many of South Carolina\\'s best and brightest, including the state\\'s last two governors, Nobel Prize winning physicist Charles Townes and actress Joanne Woodward.\\nBut by the early 1980s, its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade. \\n\\n\"It was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class,\" says Linda Ward, the school\\'s principal. \"Crime was awful, test scores were low, and there was no enrollment in honors programs.\" \\n\\nMrs. Ward took over in 1986, becoming the school\\'s seventh principal in 15 years.\\nHer immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown.\\nPrior to his term, a teacher bled to death in the halls, stabbed by a student.\\nAcademically, Mrs. Ward says, the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two disparate, and evenly split, student groups: a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks, many of them poor, from run-down, inner city neighborhoods. \\n\\nMrs. Ward resolved to clean out \"deadwood\" in the school\\'s faculty and restore safety, and she also had some new factors working in her behalf.\\nOne was statewide school reform, which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment.\\nAnother was Nancy Yeargin, who came to Greenville in 1985, full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward. \\n\\n\"Being a teacher just became my life,\" says the 37-year-old Mrs. Yeargin, a teacher for 12 years before her dismissal. \"I loved the school, its history.\\nI even dreamt about school and new things to do with my students.\" \\n\\nWhile Mrs. Ward fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve curriculum, Mrs. Yeargin worked 14-hour days and fast became a student favorite.\\nIn 1986-87 and 1987-88, she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law.\\nEncouraged by Mrs. Ward, Mrs. Yeargin taught honor students in the state \"teacher cadet\" program, a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career.\\nShe won grant money for the school, advised cheerleaders, ran the pep club, proposed and taught a new \"Cultural Literacy\" class in Western Civilization and was chosen by the school PTA as \"Teacher of the Year.\" \\n\\n\"She was an inspirational lady; she had it all together,\" says Laura Dobson, a freshman at the University of South Carolina who had Mrs. Yeargin in the teacher-cadet class last year.\\nShe says that because of Mrs. Yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher.\\nMary Beth Marchand, a Greenville 11th grader, also says Mrs. Yeargin inspired her to go into education. \"She taught us more in Western Civilization than I\\'ve ever learned in other classes,\" says Kelli Green, a Greenville senior. \\n\\nIn the classroom, students say, Mrs. Yeargin distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches -- forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using college-bowl type competitions.\\nOn weekends, she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes, even to polish the furniture in her classroom. \\n\\n\"She just never gave it up,\" says Mary Marchand, Mary Beth\\'s mother. \"You\\'d see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game.\" \\n\\nSome fellow teachers, however, viewed Mrs. Yeargin as cocky and too yielding to students.\\nMrs. Ward says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grandstander.\\nPressures began to build.\\nFriends told her she was pushing too hard.\\nBecause of deteriorating hearing, she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer. \\n\\nMrs. Yeargin\\'s extra work was also helping her earn points in the state\\'s incentive-bonus program.\\nBut the most important source of points was student improvement on tests.\\nHuge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 meant a total of $5,000 in bonuses over two years -- a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $23,000. \\n\\nWinning a bonus for a third year wasn\\'t that important to her, Mrs. Yeargin insists.\\nBut others at Greenville High say she was eager to win -- if not for money, then for pride and recognition.\\nMary Elizabeth Ariail, another social-studies teacher, says she believed Mrs. Yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that wouldn\\'t demand good hearing.\\nIndeed, Mrs. Yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program. \\n\\nLast March, after attending a teaching seminar in Washington, Mrs. Yeargin says she returned to Greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she hadn\\'t prepared her low-ability geography students adequately.\\nWhen test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time, she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students. \\n\\nMrs. Yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct. \"I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation,\" she says. \"Only five of the 40 questions were geography questions.\\nThe rest were history, sociology, finance -- subjects they never had.\" \\n\\nMrs. Yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift Greenville High School\\'s overall test scores, usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers.\\nMostly, she says, she wanted to prevent the damage to self-esteem that her low-ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test. \"These kids broke my heart,\" she says. \"A whole day goes by and no one even knows they\\'re alive.\\nThey desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them, who loved them.\\nThe last thing they needed was another drag-down blow.\" \\n\\nSchool officials and prosecutors say Mrs. Yeargin is lying.\\nThey found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help, although because the case wasn\\'t tried in court, this evidence was never presented publicly. \"That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child,\" says Joe Watson, the prosecutor in the case, who is also president of Greenville High School\\'s alumni association.\\nMrs. Yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class, adding: \"I wanted to help all\" students. \\n\\nMr. Watson says Mrs. Yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair. \"Do I have much sympathy for her?\" Mr. Watson asks. \"Not really.\\nI believe in the system.\\nI believe you have to use the system to change it.\\nWhat she did was like taking the law into your own hands.\" \\n\\nMrs. Ward says that when the cheating was discovered, she wanted to avoid the morale-damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring.\\nShe says she offered Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate.\\nMrs. Yeargin declined. \"She said something like `You just want to make it easy for the school. \\' I was dumbfounded,\" Mrs. Ward recalls. \"It was like someone had turned a knife in me.\" \\n\\nTo the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs. Yeargin won widespread local support.\\nThe school-board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students, teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf.\\nSupportive callers decried unfair testing, not Mrs. Yeargin, on a local radio talk show on which she appeared. \\n\\nThe show didn\\'t give the particulars of Mrs. Yeargin\\'s offense, saying only that she helped students do better on the test. \"The message to the board of education out of all this is we\\'ve got to take a serious look at how we\\'re doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state,\" said the talk-show host.\\nEditorials in the Greenville newspaper allowed that Mrs. Yeargin was wrong, but also said the case showed how testing was being overused. \\n\\nThe radio show \"enraged us,\" says Mrs. Ward.\\nPartly because of the show, Mr. Watson says, the district decided not to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record.\\nAnd legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case.\\nOver 50 witnesses, mostly students, were interviewed. \\n\\nAt Greenville High School, meanwhile, some students -- especially on the cheerleading squad -- were crushed. \"It\\'s hard to explain to a 17-year-old why someone they like had to go,\" says Mrs. Ward.\\nSoon, T-shirts appeared in the corridors that carried the school\\'s familiar red-and-white GHS logo on the front.\\nOn the back, the shirts read, \"We have all the answers.\" Many colleagues are angry at Mrs. Yeargin. \"She did a

students can often find the answer in test-coaching workbooks and worksheets their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests. \\n\\nThe mathematics section of the widely used California Achievement Test asks fifth graders: \"What is another name for the Roman numeral IX?\" It also asks them to add two-sevenths and three-sevenths. \\n\\nWorksheets in a test-practice kit called Learning Materials, sold to schools across the country by Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co., contain the same questions.\\nIn many other instances, there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials.\\nWhat\\'s more, the test and Learning Materials are both produced by the same company, Macmillan/McGraw-Hill, a joint venture of McGraw-Hill Inc. and Macmillan\\'s parent, Britain\\'s Maxwell Communication Corp. \\n\\nClose parallels between tests and practice tests are common, some educators and researchers say.\\nTest-preparation booklets, software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry.\\nBut some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of school-sponsored cheating. \\n\\n\"If I took {these preparation booklets} into my classroom, I\\'d have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it wasn\\'t cheating,\" says John Kaminski, a Traverse City, Mich., teacher who has studied test coaching.\\nHe and other critics say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests, which is to gauge learning progress. \\n\\n\"It\\'s as if France decided to give only French history questions to students in a European history class, and when everybody aces the test, they say their kids are good in European history,\" says John Cannell, an Albuquerque, N.M., psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization, Friends for Education, which has studied standardized testing. \\n\\nStandardized achievement tests are given about 10 million times a year across the country to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade.\\nThe most widely used of these tests are Macmillan/McGraw\\'s CAT and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills; the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, by Houghton Mifflin Co.; and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. \\'s Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stanford Achievement Test. \\n\\nSales figures of the test-prep materials aren\\'t known, but their reach into schools is significant.\\nIn Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina and Texas, educators say they are common classroom tools. \\n\\nMacmillan/McGraw says \"well over 10 million\" of its Scoring High test-preparation books have been sold since their introduction 10 years ago, with most sales in the last five years.\\nAbout 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers\\' binders have also been sold in the past four years.\\nThe materials in each set reach about 90 students.\\nScoring High and Learning Materials are the best-selling preparation tests. \\n\\nMichael Kean, director of marketing for CTB Macmillan/McGraw, the Macmillan/McGraw division that publishes Learning Materials, says it isn\\'t aimed at improving test scores.\\nHe also asserted that exact questions weren\\'t replicated.\\nWhen referred to the questions that matched, he said it was coincidental. \\n\\nMr. Kaminski, the schoolteacher, and William Mehrens, a Michigan State University education professor, concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials shouldn\\'t be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test.\\nThey devised a 69-point scale -- awarding one point for each subskill measured on the CAT test -- to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth-grade CAT. \\n\\nBecause many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures, metric measurement of volume, or pie and bar graphs, for example -- are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum, Mr. Kaminski says, the preparation kits wouldn\\'t replicate too many, if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures.\\nBut Learning Materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills.\\nScoring High matched on 64.5. \\n\\nIn CAT sections where students\\' knowledge of two-letter consonant sounds is tested, the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does -- to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know. \\n\\nLearning Materials for the fifth-grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items. \\n\\nRick Brownell, senior editor of Scoring High, says that Messrs.\\nKaminski and Mehrens are ignoring \"the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format.\" He said authors of Scoring High \"scrupulously avoid\" replicating exact questions, but he doesn\\'t deny that some items are similar. \\n\\nWhen Scoring High first came out in 1979, it was a publication of Random House.\\nMcGraw-Hill was outraged.\\nIn a 1985 advisory to educators, McGraw-Hill said Scoring High shouldn\\'t be used because it represented a \"parallel form\" of the CAT and CTBS tests.\\nBut in 1988, McGraw-Hill purchased the Random House unit that publishes Scoring High, which later became part of Macmillan/McGraw.\\nMessrs.\\nBrownell and Kean say they are unaware of any efforts by McGraw-Hill to modify or discontinue Scoring High. \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0046': '.START \\n\\nAlleghany Corp. said it completed the acquisition of Sacramento Savings & Loan Association from the H.N. & Frances C.

plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants. \\n\\nMedical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer\\'s, Parkinson\\'s and Huntington\\'s.\\nBut anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions. \\n\\nJames Mason, assistant secretary for health, said the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research \"should be continued indefinitely.\" He said the ban won\\'t stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that doesn\\'t involve transplants. \\n\\nDepartment officials say that HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan will support Dr. Mason\\'s ruling, which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the National Institutes of Health.\\nBoth Dr. Mason and Dr. Sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion, as does President Bush, except in cases where a woman\\'s life is threatened. \\n\\nThe controversy began in 1987 when the National Institutes of Health, aware of the policy implications of its research, asked for an HHS review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson\\'s disease.\\nThe department placed a moratorium on the research, pending a review of scientific, legal and ethical issues. \\n\\nA majority of an NIH-appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions, but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding.\\nThe dispute has hampered the administration\\'s efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control. \\n\\nSeveral candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants.\\nAntonio Novello, whom Mr. Bush nominated to serve as surgeon general, reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion.\\nDr. Novello is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. \\n\\nSome researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts.\\nEarlier this week, Dr. Sullivan tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the NIH and the CDC will be judged by \"standards of scientific and administrative excellence,\" not politics. \\n\\nBut the administration\\'s handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists. \"When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground, there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications,\" says Myron Genel, associate dean of the Yale Medical School. \"The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized, so that no mechanism exists\" for finding a middle ground. \\n\\nYale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants.\\nBut Dr. Genel warns that Dr. Mason\\'s ruling may discourage private funding. \"The unavailability of federal funds, and the climate in which the decision was made, certainly don\\'t provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support,\" he said. \\n\\nDespite the flap over transplants, federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts. \"Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer\" or to regulate genes that cause Down\\'s syndrome, the leading cause of mental retardation, according to an NIH summary.\\nThe NIH currently spends about $8 million annually on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of $8 billion. \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0048': '.START \\n\\nRekindled hope that two New England states will allow

remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish U.S. economic indicators, dealers note that Japanese demand has helped underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the U.S. currency from plunging below key levels against the mark. \\n\\nAt the same time, dealers said the U.S. unit has been locked into a relatively narrow range in recent weeks, in part because the hefty Japanese demand for dollars has been offset by the mark\\'s strength, resulting in a stalemate. \\n\\nJay Goldinger, with Capital Insight Inc., reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well -- the mark climbed to 77.70 yen from 77.56 yen late Tuesday in New York -- the strength of the U.S. bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar-denominated bonds, rather than mark bonds. \\n\\n\"Dollar-yen {trade} is the driving force in the market,\" said Tom Trettien, a vice president with Banque Paribas in New York, \"but I\\'m not convinced it will continue.\\nWho knows what will happen down the road, in three to six months, if foreign investment starts to erode?\" \\n\\nIn late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted

U.S. currency opened for trading at 143.93 yen, up from Wednesday\\'s Tokyo close of 143.08 yen. \\n\\nDouglas Madison, a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles, traced the dollar\\'s recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by Japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings. \\n\\nHe contends that the perception in Japan of a vitriolic U.S. response to Sony Corp. \\'s announcement of its purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. has been temporarily mollified.\\nHe cites the recent deal between the Mitsubishi Estate Co. and the Rockefeller Group, as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed Japanese company in the Georgia-Pacific Corp. takeover bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. as evidence. \\n\\nThe forthcoming maturity in November of a 10-year Japanese government yen-denominated bond issue valued at about $16 billion has prompted speculation in the market that investors redeeming the bonds will diversify into dollar-denominated instruments, according to Mr. Madison. \\n\\nIt remains unclear whether the bond issue will be rolled over. \\n\\nMeanwhile, traders in Tokyo say that the prospect of lower U.S. interest rates has spurred dollar buying by Japanese institutions. \\n\\nThey point out that these institutions want to lock in returns on high-yield U.S. Treasury debt and suggest demand for the U.S. unit will continue unabated until rates in the U.S. recede. \\n\\nThe market again showed little interest in further evidence

$70-a-share buy-back plan if pressed by Temple Holdings Ltd., which made an earlier tender offer for Sea Containers. \\n\\nSea Containers, a Hamilton, Bermuda-based shipping concern, said Tuesday that it would sell $1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50% of its common shares for $70 apiece. \\n\\nThe move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns, Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC.\\nIn May, the two companies, through their jointly owned holding company, Temple, offered $50 a share, or $777 million, for Sea Containers.\\nIn August, Temple sweetened the offer to $63 a share, or $963 million. \\n\\nYesterday, Sea Containers\\' chief executive officer, James Sherwood, said in an interview that, under the

shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer.\" \\n\\nA spokesman for Temple estimated that Sea Containers\\' plan -- if all the asset sales materialize -- would result in shareholders receiving only $36 to $45 a share in cash.\\nThe lower figures, the spokesman said, would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that Sea Containers\\' subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market. \\n\\nTemple added that Sea Containers is still mired in legal problems in Bermuda, where the Supreme Court has temporarily barred Sea Containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by Stena and Tiphook. {The court has indicated it will rule on the case by the end of the month.} \\n\\nTemple also

too high (2 responses); 2) yes, it\\'s high but I\\'ll take it (2 responses); 3) I\\'ll take all I can get (58 responses).\\nThe wine was shipped in six-bottle cases instead of the usual 12, but even at that it was spread thin, going to 62 retailers in 28 states. \\n\\n\"We thought it was awfully expensive,\" said Sterling Pratt, wine director at Schaefer\\'s in Skokie, Ill., one of the top stores in suburban Chicago, \"but there are people out there with very different opinions of value.\\nWe got our two six-packs -- and they\\'re gone.\" \\n\\nMr. Pratt remarked that he thinks steeper prices have come about because producers don\\'t like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on.\\nEven if there is consumer resistance at first, a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move. \"There may be sticker-shock reaction initially,\" said Mr. Pratt, \"but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell, they eventually get excited and decide it\\'s worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some people,\" added Larry Shapiro. \"They like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace {one of Diamond Creek\\'s Cabernets} or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet, or the Petrus.\\nProducers have seen this market opening up and they\\'re now creating wines that appeal to these people.\" \\n\\nThat explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly.\\nBut consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago. \"They won\\'t buy if the quality is not there,\" said Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans. \"Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less.\" Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines (like Grgich Hills Chardonnay, now $32) just to slow down movement, but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $30 to $40 range. \\n\\nImage has, of course, a great deal to do with what sells and what doesn\\'t, and it can\\'t be forced.\\nWine merchants can\\'t keep Roederer Cristal in stock, but they have to push Salon le Mesnil, even lowering the price from $115 to $90.\\nIt\\'s hardly a question of quality -- the 1982 Salon is a beautiful wine, but, as Mr. Pratt noted, people have their own ideas about value. \\n\\nIt\\'s interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines aren\\'t always walking out the door.\\nIn every major market in the U.S., for instance, you can buy \\'86 La Tache or Richebourg, virtually all of the first growth Bordeaux (except Petrus), as well as Opus One and Dominus from California and, at the moment, the Stag\\'s Leap 1985 Cask 23. \\n\\nWith the biggest wine-buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach, it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare.\\nBy January it should be fairly clear what\\'s hot -- and what\\'s not.

Sullivan, who runs his own bank consulting firm in Charlotte, N.C. \"This much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today\\'s rate-sensitive customers costly.\" \\n\\nPackages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place.\\nFor their troubles, the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate.\\nThe more accounts customers have, Mr. Sullivan says, the more likely they are to be attracted to a package -- and to be loyal to the bank that offers it.\\nThat can pay off down the road as customers, especially the younger ones, change from borrowers to savers/investors. \\n\\nPackaging has some drawbacks.\\nThe additional technology, personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive.\\nChemical Bank spent more than $50 million to introduce its ChemPlus line, several packages aimed at different segments, in 1986, according to Thomas Jacob, senior vice president of marketing. \"It\\'s not easy to roll out something that comprehensive, and make it pay,\" Mr. Jacob says. \\n\\nStill, bankers expect packaging to flourish, primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs. \"These days, banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them,\" Ms. Moore says.\\nSome banks are already moving in that direction, according to Alvin T.

Sayers, \"The Nine Tailors\" \\n\\nASLACTON, England -- Of all scenes that evoke rural England, this is one of the loveliest: An ancient stone church stands amid the fields, the sound of bells cascading from its tower, calling the faithful to evensong. \\n\\nThe parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door, as members here always have.\\nIn the tower, five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614. \\n\\nBut there is also a discordant, modern note in Aslacton, though it can\\'t be heard by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening. \\n\\nLike most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells, St. Michael once had its own \"band\" of ringers, who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service.\\nNow, only one local ringer remains: 64-year-old Derek Hammond. \\n\\nThe others here today live elsewhere.\\nThey belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia. \\n\\n\"To ring for even one service at this tower, we have to scrape,\" says Mr. Hammond, a retired water-authority worker. \"We\\'ve tried to train the youngsters, but they have their discos and their dances, and they just drift away.\" \\n\\nMr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing.\\nHistory, after all, is not on his side.\\nAccording to a nationwide survey taken a year ago, nearly a third of England\\'s church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them. \\n\\nIt is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes.\\nThe less complicated version of playing tunes on bells, as do the carillons of continental Europe, is considered by the English to be childish, fit only for foreigners.\\nChange-ringing, a mind-boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago, requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration. \\n\\nProper English bells are started off in \"rounds,\" from the highest-pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using, in larger churches, as many as 12 bells.\\nThen, at a signal, the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking.\\nEach variation, or change, can occur only once, the rules state.\\nRingers memorize patterns of changes, known as \"methods,\" which have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters.\\nA series of 5,000 or so changes is a \"peal\" and takes about three hours. \\n\\nA look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved.\\nTen shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle, one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter\\'s stance, each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber.\\nNo one speaks, and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves, muffled by the ceiling.\\nTotally absorbed, the ringers stare straight ahead, using peripheral vision (they call it \"rope-sight\") to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls. \\n\\nFar above in the belfry, the huge bronze bells, mounted on wheels, swing madly through a full 360 degrees, starting and ending, surprisingly, in the inverted, or mouth-up position.\\nSkilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing, so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change. \\n\\nIn a well-known detective-story involving church bells, English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a \"passion {that} finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection.\" Ringers, she added, are \"filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed.\" \\n\\n\"Ringing does become a bit of an obsession,\" admits Stephanie Pattenden, master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England\\'s best female ringers. \\n\\nIt is a passion that usually stays in the tower, however.\\nMore often than not, ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry.\\nWhen their changes are completed, and after they have worked up a sweat, ringers often skip off to the local pub, leaving worship for others below. \\n\\nThis does not sit well with some clerics.\\nWith membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling, strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services.\\nTwo years ago, the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone, vicar of Great Torrington, Devon, got so fed up with ringers who didn\\'t attend service he sacked the entire band; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest. \"They were a self-perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises,\" the Vicar Hummerstone says. \\n\\nAn entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington, several of whom are members of the congregation.\\nBut there still aren\\'t enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells. \\n\\nAt St. Mary\\'s Church in Ilminster, Somerset, the bells have fallen silent following a dust-up over church attendance.\\nThe vicar, W.D. Jones, refuses to talk about it, saying it would \"reopen the wound.\" But C.J.B. Marshall, vicar of a nearby church, feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar. \"So crunch, crunch, crunch, bang, bang, bang -- here come the ringers from above, making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer,\" he says. \\n\\nVicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue, since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself. \"The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church,\" he says. \"I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life.\" \\n\\nThe Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, a sort of parliament of ringing groups, aims to improve relations with vicars, says John C. Baldwin, president.\\nIt hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled, \"The Bells in Your Care.\" Says Mr. Baldwin, \"We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience.\" \\n\\nMr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem: lack of ringers.\\nOne survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today, only 40,000 of them still ring.\\nAlso, ringers don\\'t always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small, rural parishes and inner-city churches. \\n\\nBut the council\\'s program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful, says Mr. Baldwin. \"Right now, we\\'re lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10,\" he adds. \\n\\nOne bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field; more than a third of the ringers today are women.\\nThey aren\\'t accepted everywhere, however.\\nThe oldest bell-ringing group in the country, the Ancient Society of College Youths, founded in 1637, remains male-only, a fact that\\'s particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain\\'s most prestigious churches, St. Paul\\'s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. \\n\\nThis being Britain, no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit, but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to \"The Ringing World,\" a weekly newspaper for ringers.\\nOne writer, signing his letter as \"Red-blooded, balanced male,\" remarked on the \"frequency of women fainting in peals,\" and suggested that they \"settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings.\" \\n\\nIn the torrent of replies that followed, one woman ringer from Solihull observed that \"the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired: badly dressed, decorated with acne and a large beer-belly, frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals.\" Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing, \"I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry.\\nI have seen one or two men die, bless them.\" \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0090': '.START \\n\\nInvestors unsettled by the stock market\\'s gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks.\\nThat has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than 10%. \\n\\nBut don\\'t breathe too easy: Those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices, some analysts warn. \\n\\nIn the past, they say, the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over. \\n\\nThat can be a trap for unwary investors, says Richard Bernstein, senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. Strong dividend growth, he says, is \"the black widow of valuation\" -- a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating. \\n\\nStephen Boesel, president of T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund, explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time. \"Invariably, those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments,\" he says. \"And recessionary environments aren\\'t hospitable to the stock market.\" \\n\\nIndeed, analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks.\\nIn 1976, for example, dividends on the stocks in Standard & Poor\\'s 500-stock index soared 10%, following much slower growth the year before.\\nThe S&P index started sliding in price in September 1976, and fell 12% in 1977 -- despite a 15% expansion in dividends that year. \\n\\nThat pattern hasn\\'t always held, but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious.\\nPayouts on the S&P 500 stocks rose 10% in 1988, according to Standard & Poor\\'s Corp., and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9% and 14%.\\nMany people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year, although a minority see double-digit gains continuing. \\n\\nMeanwhile, many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag: While dividends have risen smartly, their expansion hasn\\'t kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices.\\nAs a result, the market\\'s dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of price -- has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards. \\n\\nPut another way, the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay, some market analysts say.\\nThey are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S&P 500.\\nThe figure is currently about 3.3%, up from 3.2% before the recent market slide.\\nSome analysts say investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3%. \\n\\nA drop below that 3% benchmark \"has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued,\" says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price. \\n\\nIn fact, \"the market has always tanked.\\nAlways.\\nThere\\'s never been an exception,\" says Gerald W. Perritt, a Chicago investment adviser and money manager, based on a review of six decades of stock-market data. \\n\\nThe last time the S&P 500 yield dropped below 3% was in the summer of 1987.\\nStockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle. \\n\\nThere have been only seven other times -- in 1929, 1933, 1961, 1965, 1968, 1971 and 1972 -- when the yield on the S&P 500 dropped below 3% for at least two consecutive months, Mr. Perritt found.\\nAnd in each case, he says, a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year. \\n\\nStill, some market analysts say the current 3.3% reading isn\\'t as troublesome as it might have been in years past. \"It\\'s not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner,\" says James H. Coxon, head of stock investments for Cigna Corp., the Philadelphia-based insurer. \\n\\nIn particular, Mr. Coxon says, businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically.\\nSo, while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends, they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength. \\n\\nRather than increasing dividends, some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares, notes Steven G. Einhorn, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Co.\\nHe factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6%.\\nThat is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so, he says. \\n\\nWhat will happen to dividend growth next year?\\nCommon wisdom suggests a single-digit rate of growth, reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits. \\n\\nPaineWebber Inc., for instance, is forecasting growth in S&P 500 dividends of just under 5% in 1990, down from an estimated 11% this year.\\nIn other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns -- the environment the firm expects in 1990 -- the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4% to a decline of 1% , according to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger. \\n\\nThe minority argument, meanwhile, is that businesses have the financial wherewithal this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken. \\n\\nDividend growth on the order of 12% is expected by both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs.\\nThose dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures. \\n\\nOne indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor\\'s of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends.\\nA total of 139 companies raised dividends in October, basically unchanged from 138 a year ago, S&P said Wednesday.\\nThat followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace. \\n\\nWhile the S&P tally doesn\\'t measure the magnitude of dividend changes, a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year. \\n\\nIn any case, opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels.\\nMr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a 12% to 15% total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months -- vs. a \"cash rate of return\" of perhaps 7% or 8% if dividend growth is weak. \\n\\nBut Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price, who also expects 12% growth in dividends next year, doesn\\'t think it will help the overall market all that much. \"Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook, but I don\\'t think it\\'s a main consideration,\" he says.\\nWith slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year, \"I wouldn\\'t look for the market to have much upside from current levels.\" \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0091': \".START \\n\\nYour Oct. 13 page-one story on the renewed plight of Western Union says that Western Union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down Alexander Graham Bell's offer to it of his invention, because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph. \\n\\nSuch is hardly the case.\\nBell's father-in-law, Gardner G.

phrase to describe what China believes is the policy of Western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere. \\n\\nThe tension was evident on Wednesday evening during Mr. Nixon\\'s final banquet toast, normally an opportunity for reciting platitudes about eternal friendship.\\nInstead, Mr. Nixon reminded his host, Chinese President Yang Shangkun, that Americans haven\\'t forgiven China\\'s leaders for the military assault of June 3-4 that killed hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of demonstrators. \\n\\n\"Many in the United States, including many friends of China, believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified,\" Mr. Nixon told Mr. Yang, who was directly involved in ordering the attack. \"The events of April through June damaged the respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of China.\" \\n\\nThe Chinese responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion.\\nIn talks with Mr. Nixon, Chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings, and even suggested that the U.S. was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring.\\nIn a meeting Tuesday, supreme leader, Deng Xiaoping, told Mr. Nixon, \"Frankly speaking, the U.S. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in Beijing not long ago.\\nChina was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove China for it.\" \\n\\nDespite the harsh exchanges, the U.S. and China still seem to be looking for a way to mend relations, which have deteriorated into what Mr. Nixon referred to as \"the greatest crisis in Chinese-American relations\" since his initial visit to China 17 years ago.\\nIn his return toast to Mr. Nixon, Mr. Yang said the relationship had reached a \"stalemate.\" \\n\\nRelations between China and the U.S. have been tense since June 7, when Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.\\nShortly afterwards, Mr. Bush imposed a series of anti-China sanctions, including suspension of most high-level talks, which could be codified in U.S. congressional legislation in the coming weeks. \\n\\nMr. Nixon is traveling in China as a private citizen, but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the Bush administration.\\nMr. Nixon met Mr. Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, before coming to China on Saturday.\\nAnd he plans to brief the president at the end of the week, U.S. sources said.\\nMr. Nixon was to leave China today. \\n\\nAccording to an American member of the Nixon party, the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his 20 hours of talks with top-level Chinese officials.\\nThese included China\\'s economic policies, human rights and the question of Mr. Fang.\\nMr. Nixon also proposed that China restore its participation in the Fulbright Program, a U.S. government-funded academic exchange.\\nChina pulled out of the program in July. \\n\\nIn his talks, the former president urged China\\'s leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas. \"Ideas are going over borders, and there\\'s no SDI ideological weapon that can shoot them down,\" he told a group of Americans at the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday. \\n\\nThere are no signs, however, of China\\'s yielding on key issues.\\nBut in one minor matter, Mr. Nixon appears to have gained a concession.\\nIn a meeting with Premier Li Peng on Monday, Mr. Nixon said that he hoped he wouldn\\'t encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the U.S. Embassy. \\n\\nSure enough, when he arrived at the embassy two days later, the machine-gun-toting guards were gone -- for the first time in five months.\\nA few blocks away, at the U.S. ambassador\\'s residence, the guards encircling the compound also had discarded their Uzi-model arms for the first time since early June. \\n\\nBut the guards there retained their pistols, and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars.\\nMoreover, police and soldiers continue to harass Americans, who have filed several protests with the Foreign Ministry in the past week.\\nSeveral times, Chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of U.S. diplomats and clicked the trigger.\\nThe rifles weren\\'t loaded. \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0094': '.START \\n\\nYour Oct. 6 article \"Japan\\'s Financial Firms Lure Science Graduates\" states, \"Industrial companies are accusing financial institutions of

compared with $6 billion in 1983, when Mr. Hahn took the reins.\\nProfit from continuing operations has soared to $467 million from $75 million.\\nMr. Hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best. \\n\\n\"The record of companies that have diversified isn\\'t all that impressive,\" he says. \\n\\nNekoosa wouldn\\'t be a diversification.\\nIt would be a good match, Mr. Hahn and many analysts say, of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows.\\nThe resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in the world

than $500 million in economic aid for Poland that relies heavily on $240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment. \\n\\nFor the Agency for International Development, appropriators approved $200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program, and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. are increased by $40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same Poland package. \\n\\nThe conference approved at least $55 million in direct cash and development assistance as well, and though no decision was made, both sides are committed to adding more than $200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the Bush administration. \\n\\nThe agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill, which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year's budget.\\nThese fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the Poland package, and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending, the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe. \\n\\nTo accommodate the additional cash assistance, the House Appropriations Committee last week was required to reallocate an estimated $140 million from the Pentagon.\\nAnd though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant, recent experience with a similar program in Central America indicates that it could take several years before the new Polish government can fully use the aid effectively. \\n\\nThe action on Poland came as the conference separately approved $220 million for international population planning activities, an 11% increase over fiscal 1989.\\nThe House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations, but the size of the

Article II places on the president the duty to nominate, \"and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate\" appoint, ambassadors, judges, and other officers of the U.S.\\nIt also empowers the president to make recess appointments, without Senate approval: \"The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\" \\n\\nYet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides: \"No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person.\" Thus, with one brief passage in an appropriations bill, Congress repeals the president\\'s power to make recess appointments under Article II. \\n\\nSection 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president\\'s ability to nominate candidates of his choosing.\\nThe language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person\\'s salary.\\nThe president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay, because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government. \\n\\nThe 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of \"muzzling\" provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution.\\nMuzzling provisions, which might be called \"blindfold laws\" as well, prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options, let alone from recommending them to Congress.\\nSuch laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress, but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations. \\n\\nTypically, these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations.\\nProbably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president\\'s Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny.\\nThere is something inherently suspect about Congress\\'s prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other. \\n\\nPerhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress\\'s attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill: \"None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement, administer, or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States.\" \\n\\nThis provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president\\'s execution of the law, since a one-house resolution could be said to be \"duly adopted\" even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto.\\nThe Supreme Court\\'s decision in INS v.\\nChadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional. \\n\\nPresident Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president\\'s ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives.\\nIf President Bush fails to do so in his first year, he will invite Congress, for the remainder of his presidency, to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes.\\nWhat becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents, including Democrats, to undo. \\n\\nPresident Reagan learned that lesson.\\nBy 1987, then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president, through an appropriations rider, to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II. \\n\\nIf a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded, the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision, declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable.\\nThe Constitution does not expressly give the president such power.\\nHowever, the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution.\\nThe question is whether his only means of defense is the veto. \\n\\nExcision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president\\'s duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto.\\nAs discussed in the context of controlling federal spending, the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives.\\nThe excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability.\\nOne could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president, by exerting a power of excision, to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers. \\n\\nThere is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills.\\nIf Congress does nothing, President Bush will have won.\\nIf Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court (assuming it can establish standing to sue), President Bush might win.\\nIn that case, he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president\\'s right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive. \\n\\nIf President Bush loses at the court, it might be disappointing, as Morrison v.\\nOlson was for the Reagan administration.\\nBut the presidency would be no worse off than it is now.\\nMoreover, the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice. \\n\\nAs it stands now, Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down.\\nPresident Bush should set things straight.\\nIf he does not, he will help realize Madison\\'s fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature \"everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex.\" \\n\\nMr. Sidak served as an attorney in the Reagan administration.\\nHis longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the Duke Law Journal later this year. \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0113': '.START \\n\\nDespite one of the most devastating droughts on record, net cash income in the Farm Belt rose to a new high of $59.9 billion last year. \\n\\nThe previous record was $57.7 billion in 1987, according to the Agriculture Department. \\n\\nNet cash income -- the amount left in farmers\\' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in 33 states in 1988, as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices, the department\\'s Economic Research Service reported yesterday.\\nMost of those states set farm income records. \\n\\nThe worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains.\\nWhat saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had \"mortgaged\" to the government under price-support loan programs.\\nWith prices soaring, they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at \"considerable profit,\" the agency\\'s 240-page report said. \\n\\nIn less parched areas, meanwhile, farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices. \\n\\nTo the surprise of some analysts, net cash income rose in some of the hardest-hit states, including Indiana, Illinois, Nebraska and the Dakotas.\\nAnalysts attributed the increases partly to the $4 billion disaster-assistance package enacted by Congress. \\n\\nLast year\\'s record net cash income confirms the farm sector\\'s rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s.\\nIt also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year. \\n\\nCommodity prices have been rising in recent years, with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year, as the government curtailed production with land-idling programs to reduce price-depressing surpluses.\\nAt the same time, export demand for U.S. wheat, corn and other commodities strengthened, said Keith Collins, a department analyst.\\nFarmers also benefited from strong livestock prices, as the nation\\'s cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low. \\n\\n\"All of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture,\" Mr. Collins said. \\n\\nCalifornia led the nation with $6.5 billion in net cash income last year, followed by Texas, $3.9 billion; Iowa, $3.4 billion; Florida, $3.1 billion; and Minnesota, $2.7 billion.\\nIowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income. \\n\\nDespite federal disaster relief, the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers, according to the department.\\nMany lost their farms. \\n\\nDepartment economists don\\'t expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was.\\nIndeed, net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline.\\nAt the same time, an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn, soybeans and other commodities, causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets. \\n\\nLast year, government payments to farmers slipped to less than $14.5 billion from a record $16.7 billion in 1987.\\nPayments are expected to range between $9 billion and $12 billion this year.

leave home without the American Express card. \\n\\nOr so the slogan might go.\\nAmerican Express Co. and General Motors Corp. \\'s beleaguered Buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting Buick\\'s sales while encouraging broader use of the American Express card. \\n\\nThe companies are giving four-day vacations for two to Buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the American Express green card.\\nThey have begun sending letters explaining the program, which began Oct. 18 and will end Dec. 18, to about five million card holders.\\nNeither company would disclose the program\\'s cost. \\n\\nBuick approached American Express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a \"good credit history\" and are \"good at making payments,\" says a spokeswoman for the division.\\nAmerican Express also represents the upscale image \"we\\'re trying to project,\" she adds. \\n\\nBuick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as \"the doctor\\'s car\" -- a product for upscale professionals.\\nSales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier, though industry sales fell.\\nBut since the 1990 model year began Oct. 1, Buick sales have plunged 33%. \\n\\nFor American Express, the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales, where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business.\\nTraditionally, the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses. \\n\\nPhillip Riese, an American Express executive vice president, says the promotion with Buick is his company\\'s first with an auto maker, but \"hopefully {will be} the first of many\" in the company\\'s effort to promote its green card as \"the total car-care card.\" To that end, American Express has been signing up gasoline companies, car repair shops, tire companies and car dealers to accept the card. \\n\\nMany auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card, but few card holders realize this, Mr. Riese says. \\n\\nUntil now, however, buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp. couldn\\'t put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates, says a spokesman for the GM finance arm.\\nBut GMAC approved the Buick program, he says, because the American Express green card requires payment in full upon billing, and so doesn\\'t carry any finance rates. \\n\\nMr. Riese says American Express considers GM and Buick \"very sophisticated direct-mail marketers,\" so \"by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability.\" In addition, Buick is a relatively respected nameplate among American Express card holders, says an American Express spokeswoman.\\nWhen the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases, Buick came in fourth among U.S. cars and in the top 10 of all cars, the spokeswoman says. \\n\\nAmerican Express has more than 24 million card holders in the U.S., and over half have the green card.\\nGMAC screened the card-member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $45,000 who hadn\\'t \"missed any payments,\" the Buick spokeswoman says.\\nSome 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC.\\nThese 3.8 million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off GMAC\\'s advertised finance rates, which start at 6.9% for two-year loan contracts. \\n\\nA spokesman for Visa International\\'s U.S. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards, but doesn\\'t have plans for a tie-in similar to the American Express-Buick link. \\n\\nThree divisions at American Express are working with Buick on the promotion: the establishment services division, which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card; the travel division; and the merchandise sales division. \\n\\nThe vacation packages include hotel accommodations and, in some cases, tours or tickets to local attractions, but not meals.\\nDestinations are Chicago; Honolulu; Las Vegas, Nev.; Los Angeles; Miami Beach, Fla.; New Orleans; New York; Orlando, Fla.; San Francisco; and Washington, D.C.\\nA buyer who chooses to fly to his destination must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion\\'s ticket

and options deals between a London borough council and commercial banks. \\n\\nThe ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions.\\nAs many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities.\\nAn appeal is expected. \\n\\nIn response to the ruling, gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session.\\nGilts, or British government bonds, which also fell sharply initially, retraced some of the losses to end about 3/8 point lower. \\n\\nThe council, which is alleged to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over #6 billion ($9.5 billion), lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals.\\nAt one point, Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10% of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings. \\n\\nWhen two parties engage in an interest-rate swap, they are betting against each other on future rates.\\nThus, an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments.\\nIn most of the British transactions, the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks, which would make fixed-rate payments.\\nAs interest rates rose, municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them. \\n\\nThe court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell, district auditor for Hammersmith, who argued that local councils aren\\'t vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities.\\nThe council backed the audit commission\\'s stand that the swap transactions are illegal.\\nAlthough the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital-markets transactions, the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils. \\n\\n\"While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith, it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature,\" a solicitor representing one of the banks said. \\n\\nAlready, 10 local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings.\\nOther

International. \\n\\nIf the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal, it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways, some market sources said.\\nBanks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils. \\n\\nOfficials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to

'./data/wsj_0118': '.START \\n\\nIn the aftermath of the stock market\\'s gut-wrenching 190-point drop on Oct. 13, Kidder, Peabody & Co. \\'s 1,400 stockbrokers across the country began a telephone and letter-writing campaign aimed at quashing the country\\'s second-largest program trader. \\n\\nThe target of their wrath?\\nTheir own employer, Kidder Peabody. \\n\\nSince October\\'s minicrash, Wall Street has been shaken by an explosion of resentment against program trading, the computer-driven, lightning-fast trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes. \\n\\nBut the heated fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market.\\nThe real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards.\\nProgram trading itself, according to many academics who have studied it, is merely caught in the middle of this battle, unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace.\\nThe evidence indicates that program trading didn\\'t, in fact, cause the market\\'s sharp fall on Oct. 13, though it may have exacerbated it. \\n\\nOn one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms, their pension fund clients with immense pools of money, and the traders at the fast-growing Chicago futures exchanges.\\nThese are the main proponents of program trading. \\n\\nDefending their ramparts are Wall Street\\'s Old Guard -- the traditional, stock-picking money managers, tens of thousands of stock brokers, the New York Stock Exchange\\'s listed companies and the clannish floor traders, known as specialists, who make markets in their stocks. \\n\\nSo far, Wall Street\\'s Old Guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle, successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their tormentors. \\n\\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a major futures marketplace, yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market, and the Big Board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading. \\n\\nStung by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot, almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage, a common form of program trading, for their own accounts in the past few days.\\nA few, such as giant Merrill Lynch & Co., now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients. \\n\\nThe Old Guard\\'s assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based, in part because some Old Guard members feel their very livelihood is at stake.\\nSome, such as traditional money manager Neuberger & Berman, have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators \"stop the numbers racket on Wall Street.\" \\n\\nBig Board stock specialists, in a bold palace revolt, began shortly after Oct. 13 to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the Big Board to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading. \\n\\nCharles Wohlstetter, the chairman of Contel Corp. who is rallying other CEOs to the anti-program trading cause, says he has received \"countless\" letters offering support. \"They said universally, without a single exception: Don\\'t even compromise.\\nKill it,\" he says. \\n\\nWall Street\\'s New Guard isn\\'t likely to take all this lying down for long, however.\\nIts new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable.\\nProgram trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country, and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them.\\nWhat\\'s more, the last time major Wall Street firms said they were getting out of program trading -- in the aftermath of the 1987 crash -- they waited a few months and then sneaked back into it. \\n\\nEven some members of the Old Guard, despite their current advantage, seem to be conceding that the future belongs with the New Guard.\\nLast week, Robert M. Bradley, one of the Big Board\\'s most respected floor traders and head of a major traders\\' organization, surrendered.\\nHe sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. in which he said the Big Board is too focused on machines, rather than people.\\nHe said the exchange is \"headed for a real crisis\" if program trading isn\\'t curbed. \\n\\n\"I do not want my money invested in what I consider as nothing more than a casino,\" Mr. Bradley wrote. \\n\\nThe battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations, causing internal contradictions and pitting employee against employee.\\nAt Kidder, a unit of General Electric Co., and other big brokerage firms, stockbrokers battle their own firm\\'s program traders a few floors away.\\nCorporations like Contel denounce program trading, yet Contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like Bankers Trust Co. that are also big program traders. \\n\\nThe Big Board -- the nation\\'s premier stock exchange -- is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives.\\nIts entrenched 49 stock specialists firms are fighting tooth and nail against programs.\\nBut the Big Board\\'s leadership -- over the specialists\\' protests -- two weeks ago began trading a new stock \"basket\" product designed to facilitate program trading. \"A lot of people would like to go back to 1970,\" before program trading, Mr. Phelan said this week. \"I would like to go back to 1970.\\nBut we are not going back to 1970.\" \\n\\nAgain and again, program-trading\\'s critics raise the \"casino\" theme.\\nThey say greedy market manipulators have made a shambles of the nation\\'s free-enterprise system, turning the stock market into a big gambling den, with the odds heavily stacked against the small investor. \"The public didn\\'t come to the market to play a game; they can go to Off-Track Betting for that,\" says A. Brean Murray, chairman of Brean Murray, Foster Securities, a traditional money management firm. \\n\\nThe program traders, on the other hand, portray old-fashioned stock pickers as the Neanderthals of the industry.\\nCritics like Mr. Murray \"are looking for witches, and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman,\" says J. Thomas Allen, president of Advanced Investment Management Inc., a Pittsburgh firm that runs a $200 million fund that uses index arbitrage. \"Just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection.\" \\n\\nFor all the furor, there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage, the most controversial type of computer-assisted program trading.\\nLike other forms of arbitrage, it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case, a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago futures markets. \\n\\nThat divergence is what stock index traders seek.\\nWhen it occurs, the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks (such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 stock index) in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market; they lock in the difference in price as profit. \\n\\nSuch program trades, which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock, occur in a matter of seconds.\\nA program trade of $5 million of stock typically earns a razor-thin profit of $25,000.\\nTo keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives, traders must seize every opportunity their computers find. \\n\\nThe speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics profess to despise. \"If you continue to do this, the investor becomes frightened -- any investor: the odd lotter, mutual funds and pension funds,\" says Larry Zicklin, managing partner at Neuberger & Berman. \\n\\nBut many experts and traders say that program trading isn\\'t the main reason for stock-market gyrations. \"I have not seen one iota of evidence\" to support restrictions on program trading, says a Vanderbilt University finance professor, Hans Stoll, an authority on the subject.\\nSays the Big Board\\'s Mr. Phelan, \"Volatility is greater than program trading.\" \\n\\nThe Oct. 13 plunge was triggered not by program traders, but by news of the unraveling of the $6.79 billion buy-out of UAL Corp. Unable to unload UAL and other airline shares, takeover-stock speculators, or risk arbitragers, dumped every blue-chip stock they had.\\nWhile program trades swiftly kicked in, a \"circuit breaker\" that halted trading in stock futures in Chicago made some program trading impossible.\\nSusan Del Signore, head trader at Travelers Investment Management Co., says critics are ignoring \"the role the {takeover stock} speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility.\" Many arbs are \"overleveraged,\" she says, and they \"have to sell when things look like they fall apart.\" \\n\\nLike virtually everything on Wall Street, the program-trading battle is over money, and the traditionalists have been losing out on bundles of it to the New Guard in recent years.\\nTake the traditional money managers, or \"stock pickers,\" as they are derisively known among the computer jockeys.\\nTraditional stock managers like to charge 50 cents to 75 cents for every $100 they manage for big institutional investors, and higher fees for smaller investors.\\nYet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with, much less beat, the returns of standard benchmarks like the S&P \\n\\nNot surprisingly, old-style money managers have been losing clients to giant stock-index funds that use computers to juggle portfolios so they mirror the S&P 500.\\nThe indexers charge only a few pennies per $100 managed.\\nToday, about $200 billion, or 20% of all pension-fund stock investments, is held by index funds. \\n\\nThe new Wall Street of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the 49 Big Board stock-specialist firms.\\nThese small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of 30% to 40% a year on their capital, by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks.\\nThe specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death knell. \\n\\nAnd they believe the Big Board, under Mr. Phelan, has abandoned their interest.\\nThe son of a specialist and once one himself, Mr. Phelan has nonetheless been striving -- with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much -- to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets. \\n\\nMeanwhile, specialists\\' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility. \"When the sell programs hit, you can hear the order printers start to go\" on the Big Board trading floor, says one specialist there. \"The buyers walk away, and the specialist is left alone\" as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks, he contends. \\n\\nNo one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation\\'s stockbrokers.\\nThey are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the 1987 stock-market crash and the market\\'s swings since then. \"Small investors are absolutely dismayed that Wall Street is stacking the deck against them, and these wide swings are scaring them to death,\" says Raymond A. Mason, chairman of regional broker Legg Mason Inc. in Baltimore.\\nStockbrokers\\' business and pay has been falling.\\nLast year, the average broker earned $71,309, 24% lower than in 1987. \\n\\nCorporate executives resent that their company\\'s stock has been transformed into a nameless piece of a stock-index basket.\\nIndex traders who buy all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 often don\\'t even know what the companies they own actually do, complains Andrew Sigler, chairman of Champion International Corp. \"Do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs?\\nOh, you\\'re in the paper business,\" is one reaction Mr. Sigler says he\\'s gotten from his big institutional shareholders. \\n\\nBy this September, program traders were doing a record 13.8% of the Big Board\\'s average daily trading volume.\\nAmong the top practitioners were Wall Street blue bloods: Morgan Stanley & Co., Kidder Peabody, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Group Inc.\\nBut then came Oct. 13 and the negative publicity orchestrated by the Old Guard, particularly against index arbitrage.\\nThe indexers\\' strategy for the moment is to hunker down and let the furor die. \"There\\'s a lynch-mob psychology right now,\" says the top program-trading official at a Wall Street firm. \"Wall Street\\'s cash cow has been gored, but I don\\'t think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem.\" \\n\\nToo much money is at stake for program traders to give up.\\nFor example, stock-index futures began trading in Chicago in 1982, and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched.\\nStock futures trading has minted dozens of millionaires in their 20s and 30s.\\nNow, on a good day, Chicago\\'s stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the Big Board trades in stock. \\n\\nNow the stage is set for the battle to play out.\\nThe anti-programmers are getting some helpful thunder from Congress.\\nProgram traders\\' \"power to create total panic is so great that they can\\'t be allowed to have their way,\" says Rep. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. \"We have to have a system that says to those largest investors: `Sit down! You will not panic, you will not put the financial system in jeopardy. \\'\" \\n\\nBut the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon.\\nMany people, including the Big Board, think that it\\'s too late to put the genie back in the bottle.\\nThe Big Board\\'s directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions, but a total ban isn\\'t being considered, Big Board officials say. \\n\\n\"You\\'re not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks,\" says Vanderbilt\\'s Prof.\\nStoll. \"Program trading is here to stay, and computers are here to stay, and we just need to understand it.\" \\n\\nShort of a total ban, some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms, which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors don\\'t. \\n\\nOne such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement -- or the \"good-faith\" payment of cash needed to trade them -- to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks.\\nCurrently, margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- roughly 7% compared with 50% for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative.\\nProgram trading critics also want the Federal Reserve Board, rather than the futures industry, to set such margins. \\n\\nFutures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active.\\nHigher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell, they say. \\n\\nAnother proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an \"uptick rule\"a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices, namely short sellers.\\nThe Big Board\\'s uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price. \\n\\nBut in 1986, program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations, to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets.\\nA reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably.\\nProgram traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the \"pricing efficiency\" of the futures and stock markets. \\n\\nJames A. White contributed to this article. \\n\\nFundamentalists Jihad .START \\n\\nBig Board Chairman John Phelan said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild stock-price swings.\\nThus the band-wagon psychology of recent days picks up new impetus. \\n\\nIndex arbitrage is a common form of program trading.\\nAs usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept: Two separate markets in different locations, trading basically the same widgets, can\\'t trade them for long at prices that are widely different.\\nIn index arbitrage, the widget is the S&P 500, and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in Chicago and the stock markets largely in New York.\\nTo profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity, someone who owns the S&P 500 widget in New York must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S&P 500 widget in Chicago. \\n\\nIf the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the S&P 500 index, he is likely to remain fully invested at all times. (Few, if any, index-fund managers will risk leveraging performance by owning more than 100% exposure to stocks, and equally few will want to own less than a 100% position should stocks rise.) \\n\\nBy constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget, index-arbitrage traders hope to add between 1% and 3% to the annual return of the S&P 500.\\nThat represents a very thin \"excess\" return, certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective.\\nThe fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the S&P 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue. \\n\\nAs more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy, these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and, eventually, eliminated.\\nThe current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market.\\nThe New York Stock Exchange\\'s attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors\\' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares. \\n\\nSo if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget, how did \"program trading\" evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers?\\nAll arguments against program trading, even those pressed without fact, conclude with three expected results after \"reforms\" are implemented: 1) reduced volatility, 2) a long-term investment focus, and 3) a level playing field for the small investor.\\nBut many of these reforms are unneeded, even harmful. \\n\\nReducing volatility.\\nAn index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in New York and Chicago to cover all transaction costs.\\nArbitrage doesn\\'t cause volatility; it responds to it.\\nThink about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S&P 500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in Chicago. \\n\\nA large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures.\\nArbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from Chicago to New York, while functioning as a buyer in Chicago.\\nThe start of the whole process is the key-someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move. \\n\\nWhy does this large hypothetical seller trade in Chicago instead of New York?\\nPerhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade.\\nIn a competitive market, this investor has many ways to execute his transactions, and he will have more alternatives (both foreign and domestic) if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle.\\nIf not Chicago, then in New York; if not the U.S., then overseas. \\n\\nVolatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage, but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity.\\nEliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising, creating more volatility instead of less.\\nThe speed of his transaction isn\\'t to be feared either, because faster and cleaner execution is desirable, not loathsome.\\nIf slowing things down could reduce volatility, stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future. \\n\\nEncouraging long-term investing.\\nWe must be very cautious about labeling investors as \"long-term\" or \"short-term.\" Policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the Big Board\\'s door saying: \"Buyers welcome, sellers please go away!\" The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive, and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term.\\nA free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate. \\n\\nIn point of fact, volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today.\\nPeriods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile, usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change (1973-75, 1937-40, and 1928-33 for example).\\nIt is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream \"foul\" on program trading when the markets decline, while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise.\\nCould rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks, instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins? \\n\\nSome of the proposed fixes for what is labeled \"program-trading volatility\" could be far worse than the perceived problem.\\nIn using program trading as a whipping boy, fundamentalist investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing stock-selection products.\\nThey may, however, risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves.\\nHow does a nice new tax, say 5%, on any financial transaction sound?\\nThat ought to make sure we\\'re all thinking for the long term. \\n\\nGetting a level playing field.\\nThis argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program trading -- not because of its merits, but because of the firms championing the cause.\\nThe loudest of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors.\\nThey continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell, while their clients continue to hope for superior performance.\\nEven with mutual funds, the little investor continues to tolerate high fees, high commissions and poor performance, while index-fund managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees, lower commissions and less risk.\\nYet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert studiously devouring press clippings on each company he follows. \\n\\nAlmost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy, and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences. \\n\\nIf spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous, surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small investors.\\nThe sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue stellar performers first, while leaving institutions to grapple with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter.\\nCost-effective index funds just aren\\'t sexy enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay, and that institutional customers refuse to pay. \\n\\nEach new trading roadblock is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their high-volume clients, here or overseas.\\nLegislating new trading inefficiencies will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors. \\n\\nSo what is next for program trading?\\nLeft to its own devices, index arbitrage will become more and more efficient, making it harder and harder to do profitably.\\nSpreads will become so tight that it won\\'t matter which market an investor chooses -- arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit. \\n\\nIf government or private watchdogs insist, however, on introducing greater friction between the markets (limits on price moves, two-tiered execution, higher margin requirements, taxation, etc.), the end loser will be the markets themselves.\\nInstead, we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants. \\n\\nMr. Allen\\'s Pittsburgh firm, Advanced Investment Management Inc., executes program trades for institutions. \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0119': '.START \\n\\nSome Democrats in Congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years. \\n\\nThe funding mechanism, which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by President Bush, would affect the antitrust operations of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. \\n\\nAs a part of overall efforts to reduce spending, Congress cut by $30 million the Bush administration\\'s request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1.\\nTo offset the reduction, Congress approved a $20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers, acquisitions and certain other transactions. \\n\\nSome Democrats, led by Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas), unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts. \\n\\nBut Justice Department and FTC officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them. \"It could operate to augment our budget,\" James Rill, the Justice Department\\'s antitrust chief, said in an interview. \\n\\nUnder measures approved by both houses of Congress, the administration\\'s request for $47 million for the Antitrust Division would be cut $15 million.\\nThe FTC budget request of $70 million, about $34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement, would also be cut by $15 million.\\nThe administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 as was appropriated in fiscal 1989. \\n\\nThe offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.\\nUnder that law, parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $15 million or more must notify FTC and Justice Department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions.\\nCurrently, the government charges nothing for such filings. \\n\\nProponents of the funding arrangement predict that, based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year, the fees will yield at least $40 million this fiscal year, or $10 million more than the budget cuts. \"When you do that, there is not a cut, but there is in fact a program increase of $5 million\" each for the FTC and the Justice Department, Rep. Neal Smith (D., Iowa) said during House debate. \\n\\nBut Rep. Don Edwards (D., Calif.) responded that a recession could stifle merger activity, reducing the amount of fees collected.\\nThe antitrust staffs of both the FTC and Justice Department were cut more than 40% in the Reagan administration, and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period. \"Today is not the time to signal that Congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen,\" Mr. Edwards argued. \\n\\nAny money in excess of $40 million collected from the fees in fiscal 1990 would go to the Treasury at large. \\n\\nCorporate lawyers said the new fees wouldn\\'t inhibit many mergers or other transactions.\\nThough some lawyers reported that prospective acquirers were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect, government officials said they hadn\\'t noticed any surge in filings. \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0120': '.START \\n\\nFALL BALLOT ISSUES set a record for off-year elections. \\n\\nOdd-year

'./data/wsj_0128': '.START \\n\\nWall Street\\'s big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered. \\n\\nThe reason: Risks from the firms\\' new \"merchant banking\" activities are rising as revenue from the industry\\'s traditional business erodes. \\n\\nThe downgrading of debt issued by CS First Boston Inc., parent of First Boston Corp., by Moody\\'s Investors Service Inc., coupled with a Moody\\'s announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. is under review for a possible downgrade, sent shivers through the brokerage community this week.\\nWith the shudders came the realization that some of Wall Street\\'s biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably. \\n\\nSecurities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs, which they sell to finance their daily operations.\\nThe biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper. \\n\\nBut Moody\\'s warned that Shearson\\'s commercial paper rating could be lowered soon, a move that would reduce Shearson\\'s profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms.\\nShearson is 62%-owned by American Express Co. \\n\\n\"Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business, so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s,\" says Christopher T. Mahoney, a Moody\\'s vice president. \"A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible.\" Standard & Poor\\'s Corp. says First Boston, Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., in particular, are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead. \\n\\nWhat worries credit-rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings.\\nThat\\'s a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors.\\nWhereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly, Wall Street\\'s new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years. \\n\\n\"The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays\" in getting their money back, says Jeffrey Bowman, a vice president at S&P, which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston. \\n\\n\"Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation,\" says Mr. Mahoney of Moody\\'s.\\nMerchant banking, where firms commit their own money, \"is getting riskier, and there\\'s less of it to go around.\" In addition, he says, the buy-out business is under pressure \"because of the junk bond collapse,\" meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks. \\n\\nIn a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing, with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company\\'s operations or sales of its assets. \\n\\nIn a recent report, Moody\\'s said it \"expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry, which, combined with overcapacity, will create poor prospects for profitability.\" It said that the \"temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor.\" \\n\\nBoth Moody\\'s and S&P cited First Boston\\'s reliance in recent years on merchant banking, which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm\\'s profit.\\nThe recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp., First Boston\\'s most lucrative client of the decade, is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $3 billion of high-yield, high-risk junk financings for Campeau units.\\nIn addition, a big loan that First Boston made to Ohio Mattress Co. wasn\\'t repaid on time when its $450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn. \\n\\n\"These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston\\'s equity,\" Moody\\'s said. \"Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm\\'s equity.\" CS First Boston, however, benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder, Credit Suisse, Switzerland\\'s third largest bank. \\n\\nShearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy-out business.\\nBut its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail, or individual investor, business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the October 1987 stock market crash.\\nIn addition, Shearson\\'s listed $2 billion of capital is overstated, according to the rating concerns, because it includes $1.7 billion of goodwill.\\nShearson \"really only has $300 million of capital,\" says Mr. Bowman of S&P. \\n\\nA Shearson spokesman said the firm isn\\'t worried. \"A year ago, Moody\\'s also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade,\" he said. \"After two months of talks, our rating was maintained.\" Drexel, meanwhile, already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating. \\n\\nThe collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel, the leading underwriter in that market.\\nThe firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider-trading scandal.\\nDrexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business, cutting the firm\\'s workforce almost in half to just over 5,000. \\n\\nRecently, Drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years.\\nThe firm\\'s capital, moreover, hasn\\'t grown at the same rate as in the past, officials at these firms say. \\n\\nDrexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness. \"We\\'re well positioned with $1.7 billion of capital,\" a Drexel spokesman said. \"And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm, the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view.\\nMoreover, we\\'ve probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in

some win the legal lottery, others get much less and contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut either way. \\n\\nDES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts.\\nCongress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs.\\nBut a 1986 law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children\\'s vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation. \\n\\nEveryone by now understands that Congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help deserving people without its becoming some billion-dollar morass.\\nWe have no doubt this is one reason judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing to trash the law in the DES cases.\\nThey must figure that justice has to get done by somebody, but know it won\\'t be done by Congress. \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0131': \".START \\n\\nOdyssey Partners Limited Partnership, an investment firm, completed the purchase of May Department Stores Co.

Treasury will issue $10 billion of 29year, nine-month bonds -- essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark 30-year bond that was sold at the previous refunding in August. \\n\\nCredit market analysts said the decision to reopen the current benchmark, the 8 1/8% bond due August 2019, is unusual because the issue trades at a premium to its face amount.\\nSome dealers said the Treasury\\'s intent is to help government bond dealers gauge investor demand for the securities, given uncertainties about when the auction will occur. \\n\\nThe Treasury said the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling.\\nUntil such action takes places, the Treasury has no ability to issue new debt of any kind.

to buy futures contracts, many remained skeptical about the Brazilian development, which couldn\\'t be confirmed, analysts said. \\n\\nThe March and May contracts rose to fresh life-of-contract highs

advances. \\n\\nAccording to reports carried by various news services, the Brazilian government told its sugar producers that they won\\'t be allowed to export sugar during the current 1989-90 season, which began May 1, and the 1990-91 season so that it can be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel. \\n\\nOne analyst, Arthur Stevenson, of Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, estimated that 65% or more of Brazil\\'s newly made automobiles run on alcohol and can\\'t use gasoline. \"This is a demand that must be met, regardless of the price of oil,\" said Mr. Stevenson. \\n\\nBrazil is the third-largest producer and the fifth-largest exporter of sugar in the world.\\nA shift to producing more alcohol and less sugar had been expected, but the latest news, if true, indicates a more drastic shift than had been anticipated. \\n\\nDuring the current crop year, Brazil was expected to produce 6.9 million tons of sugar, a drop from 8.1 million tons in 1988-89.\\nIts 1989-90 exports were expected to total 645,000 tons in contrast to shipments of 1.5 million tons in \\n\\n\"It is these 645,000 tons that are in question for this crop year,\" explained Judith Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York. \"Producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued\" yesterday. \\n\\nAs a result, Ms. Ganes said, it is believed that little or no sugar from the 1989-90 crop has been shipped yet, even though the crop year is six months old.\\nMore than a half of all sugar produced in Brazil goes for alcohol production, according to Ms. Ganes.\\nAlso, there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane, and this change is being felt now, she said. \\n\\nMost important, Ms. Ganes noted, \"Brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports.\" \\n\\nThomas Oxnard, sugar analyst for PaineWebber in Hackensack, N.J., said: \"I am highly skeptical that Brazil will curtail sugar exports, particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound.\" \\n\\nAbove all, Mr. Oxnard noted, the situation is extremely confused. \"Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation,\" he said. \"It\\'s the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out, such as the one saying exports will be suspended, and no one can confirm it.\" \\n\\nMr. Oxnard observed that the situation in Brazil is also very complicated.\\nOn the one hand, Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program. \\n\\n\"It has to weigh, on the other hand, the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol,\" Mr. Oxnard said. \\n\\nMexico, which is normally a sugar exporter, has had production problems in the past two years, analysts said.\\nLast year, it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments, they noted.\\nThis year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs, analysts said.

Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat.\\nTraders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S.\\nThat designation would, among other things, provide more generous credit terms under which the Soviets could purchase grain.\\nThe Soviets are widely believed to need additional supplies,

Harrison Jr., lead us along the path Wedtech traveled, from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor, entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy. \\n\\nThe book revolves around John Mariotta, the founder of the company, and Fred Neuberger, who became his partner soon after Wedtech\\'s creation.\\nAlthough started in 1965, Wedtech didn\\'t really get rolling until 1975, when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government\\'s Section 8(A) minority business program.\\nThis is a Johnson-era, Great Society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses.\\nMr. Neuberger realized that, although of Italian ancestry, Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico.\\nThe two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation.\\nInstead of 50/50 it became, on paper only, two-thirds Mariotta, one-third Neuberger, and they were in the program and off to the races. \\n\\nBesides being a \"minority-owned company\" Wedtech was located in the South Bronx, a blighted area, made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign.\\nThe company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan \\'80s. \\n\\nStarting with Congressman Mario Biaggi (now serving a jail sentence), the company began a career of bribing federal, state and local public officials and those close to public officials, right up to and including E. Robert Wallach, close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese.\\nWedtech didn\\'t just use old fashioned bribery.\\nIt made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling, retaining politically connected \"respectable\" law firms, investment bankers and political consultants, including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger.\\nWhen necessary, it sought and received assistance from organized crime. \\n\\nSometimes the bribed became partners in the company.\\nWedtech management used the merit system.\\nIf you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag, but equity.\\nIf you were not an effective crook, you found yourself out in the cold, a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta, the firm\\'s semiliterate \"minority\" person. \\n\\nBut despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy, easy-to-read tabloid writing style, \"Feeding Frenzy\" often falls short of gripping reading.\\nNone of the scams show much ingenuity: Auditors found crookery the first day on the job.\\nWedtech\\'s scammers simply bribed them to shut up. \\n\\nThe scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes, conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses, Mercedes cars, beautiful women, expensive clothes.\\nAmong the lot of them, not one is wrestling with good and evil, or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane.\\nThe one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz, a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack.\\nHe enters the story toward the end, just in time to get arrested. \\n\\nAbsorbed in doling out \"Feeding Frenzy\\'s\" tidbits, the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech, namely the Section 8(A) federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place.\\nThey do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end \"rigid affirmative action programs.\" Programs like Section 8(A) are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up.\\nNumerous other scandals, among them the ones at HUD, have the same characteristics as Wedtech.\\nThey take place in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption. \\n\\nWhy are programs like this not eliminated? \"Feeding Frenzy\" does provide a few clues.\\nIn and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party.\\nThey know that whenever government is redistributing wealth, regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment, there is big money to be made in influencing, brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government.\\nThey are our version of the East bloc\\'s Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change.\\nHow many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders?\\nThis is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal. \\n\\nMr. Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp., 1983-85. \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0187': '.START \\n\\nThe Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard\\'s backlog of 15 ships. \\n\\nThe new company will attempt to limit the shipyard\\'s losses, participants said. \"The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business.\\nEverything will be taken over by the new company,\" said Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine. \\n\\nOnce its ownership is finalized, the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine\\'s shipyard facilities.\\nSubcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine\\'s two big shipyards, government officials said. \\n\\nUnder an accord signed yesterday, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company, each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa ($23.5 million).\\nOy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company. \\n\\nCustomers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine\\'s undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said. \\n\\nWaertsilae Marine\\'s biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc.

trains to move the recently harvested Midwest crop to ports for loading onto Soviet ships. \\n\\nRiver barge rates have soared 40% this fall from a year earlier.\\nRailroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business.\\nAnd some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the Soviets. \\n\\nThe Soviet Union bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn in October, which is the most ever sold to the Soviet Union in one month from the U.S.\\nThe Soviet Union wants much of it delivered by January, which would be a strain in most years. \\n\\nBut it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River, on which flows much of the U.S. corn that is shipped overseas. \\n\\n\"We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record,\" said William Dunton, a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert. \"It is going to be real tight.\" \\n\\nBecause of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains, the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges their tows push at one time. \\n\\nIn a few weeks, many barges probably won\\'t be able to operate fully loaded south of St. Louis because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the Missouri River, which feeds into the Mississippi River.\\nThe Army Corps is cutting the flow of the Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it. \\n\\nBarge rates on the Mississippi River sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the Midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation. \\n\\nBut the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month.\\nAt St. Louis, the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed, an Army Corps spokesman said.\\nSimilar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years. \\n\\nSo far, the grain industry\\'s budding logistical problems haven\\'t been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade.\\nMany grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers. \\n\\nAt the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $2.375 a bushel. \\n\\nCorn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought.\\nWith the harvest winding down, however, some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver. \\n\\nFarmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices.\\nBecause the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles, they have more than enough storage space for their new crop, and that permits them to wait for prices to rise. \\n\\nIn parts of Iowa, for example, some grain elevators are offering farmers $2.15 a bushel for corn.\\nMany farmers probably wouldn\\'t sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel, said Lyle Reed, president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo, Iowa. \\n\\nIt isn\\'t clear, however, who would win a waiting game.\\nAlthough U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought, the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins. \\n\\nSome analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry\\'s problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation. \"The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped,\" said Bill Biedermann, Allendale Inc. research director. \\n\\nAlthough much of this country\\'s export corn goes to New Orleans by barge, it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port. \\n\\nPorts in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast can also relieve pressure on New Orleans.\\nOne railroad, for example, is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore. \\n\\nAnd it isn\\'t clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace.\\nThe Soviet orders were compressed into the month of October because of delays.\\nThe Soviet Union usually begins buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall.\\nBut its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems. \\n\\nIn other commodity markets yesterday: \\n\\nENERGY: Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading, but much of the action was in heating oil.\\nPrices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire, tightening an already tight European market.\\nHeating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon, up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\\nWest Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 22 cents to $19.94 a barrel.\\nGasoline futures continued a sell-off that began Monday. \\n\\nPRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets.\\nDecember delivery gold fell $3.20 an ounce to $377.60.\\nDecember silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $5.2180.\\nJanuary platinum was down $5.70 an ounce at $494.50.\\nPrecious metals, gold in particular, currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability, according to William O\\'Neill, vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York. \"The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities,\" he said.\\nYesterday, the stock market rose strongly, creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders, he said.\\nSilver and platinum, which have more of an industrial nature than gold, were even weaker, he said.\\nSilver is also under pressure of \"extremely high\" inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange, he said.\\nYesterday, these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces, according to an exchange spokesman. \\n\\nCOPPER: Futures prices partially recovered Monday\\'s declines because Chilean miners voted to strike.\\nThe December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $1.14.\\nIn Chile, workers at two copper mines, Los Bronces and El Soldado, which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera Disputada, yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow, an analyst said.\\nReasons for the walkout, the analyst said, included a number of procedural issues, such as a right to strike.\\nThe analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks.\\nIn the case of copper, he said, the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal.\\nAlso contributing to the firmness in copper, the analyst noted, was a report by Chicago purchasing agents, which precedes the full purchasing agents\\' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold.\\nThe Purchasing Management Association of Chicago\\'s October index rose to 51.6% after three previous months of readings below 50%.\\nThe September index was 47.1%.\\nA reading below 50% generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy, while a reading above 50% points to expansion.\\nThe Chicago report raised the possibility that the October survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management would also show a reading above 50%. \\n\\n', './data/wsj_0193': \".START \\n\\nNCR Corp.

Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), wrote in a joint letter that the president \"lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto.\" The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal. \\n\\nThe two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills, not partial measures.\\nMoreover, they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items, and there was no discussion of a line-item veto.\\nThey also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War, and \"all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach\" of the president. \\n\\nSen.
